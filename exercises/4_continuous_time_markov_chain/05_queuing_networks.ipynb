Arrivals from outside the system occur only at the machine center and follow a Poisson process with rate $\\lambda$. The machine center and inspection station are each single-server operations with rates $\\mu_1$ and $\\mu_2$. Suppose that each item independently passes inspection with probability $p$. When an object fails inspection it is sent to the machine center for reworking. Find the conditions on the parameters that are necessary for the system to have a stationary distribution.**"
