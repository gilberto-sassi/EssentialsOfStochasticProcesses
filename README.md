# EssentialsOfStochasticProcesses

Solutions and simulations from the [Essentials of Stochastic Processes](https://services.math.duke.edu/~rtd/EOSP/EOSP2021.pdf) by [Richard Durrett](https://services.math.duke.edu/~rtd/).
There is some overlap with those [solutions](https://www.studocu.com/row/document/central-university-of-finance-and-economics/stochastic-process/essentials-of-stochastic-processes-manual-solution/23978563).
Unfortunately, numbering exercises in the public version of the book and the 3rd version of the printed book are different, in this repo they are mixed as well :man_shrugging:
